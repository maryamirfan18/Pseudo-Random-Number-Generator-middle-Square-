# COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS OF THE ALGORITHM 
## TIME COMPLEXITY 
The time complexity of an algorithm can be expressed in terms of the number of operations used by the algorithm when the 
input has a particular size. <br>
Operations performed in our algorithm are that first we have taken input which would take basic n unit of time . Then, we declared a string variable which would take square of that six 
digit number.Then a while loop will add zeroes to that number until it's length is 12 digits which will take some time and for loop will repeat the whole process for 5 times.If whole process takes n time for loop will take 5n because whole process repeats 
for 5 times. 

SPACE COMPLEXITY 
 
Pseudo random number generation by mid square method 
period is usually very short and it is repeated enough times, 
the middle-square method will either begin repeatedly 
generating the same number or cycle to a previous number in 
the sequence and loop indefinitely. 
we are restricting the length of s to 12. So the space 
complexity of the above code is in the order of "s" i.e. if s 
will increase, the space requirement will also increase 
accordingly. Even when you are creating a variable then you 
need some space for your algorithm to run. All the space 
required for the algorithm is collectively called the Space 
Complexity of the algorithm which we will see in the 
algorithm when the value of s will increase.
