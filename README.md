# Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator [middle-Square]
## INTRODUCTION <br>
A number is squared and the middle digits are returned as the next random number and same method is repeated to generate pseudo random numbers. <br>
<br>
To generate a sequence of n-digit pseudorandom numbers, an n-digit starting value is created and squared, producing a 2n-digit number. If the result has fewer than 2n digits, leading zeroes are added to compensate. The middle n digits of the result would be the next number in the sequence and returned as the result. This process is then repeated to generate more numbers.<br><br>
The value of n must be even in order of the method to work – if the value of n is odd, then there will not necessarily be a uniquely defined "middle n-digits" to select from.Consider the following: If a 3-digit number is squared, it can yield a 6-digit number (e.g 5402 = 291600). If there were to be middle 3 digits, that would leave 6 − 3 = 3 digits to be distributed to the left and right of the middle. It is impossible to evenly distribute these digits equally on both sides of the middle number, and therefore there are no "middle digits". It is acceptable to pad the seeds with zeros to the left in order to create an even valued n digit number (e.g. 540 → 0540). <br><br>
